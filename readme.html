Secondary Heading: Stay the Course

In the last few years I have made a major career transition.  I have moved from the financial industry over to eCommerce.  I am continuing on this journey, the next step is front end web development.

My favorite hobbies include sports, both real and fantasy, movies and reading. What would I play at a YouTube party? Born to Run!
